# Py_work
Programs that i have been doing while learning python. Divided by directories:

- [Basics](https://github.com/DidacDV/Py_work/tree/main/Basics) : My "first" work with python, starting with the most common data-structures and functionalities (loops, exceptions...).

This will be updated while i have the required time.
