# My python work
Programs that i have been doing while learning python. Divided by directories:

- [Basics](https://github.com/DidacDV/Py_work/tree/main/Basics) : My "first" work with python, starting with the most common data-structures and functionalities (loops, exceptions...).


- [Modules-inp_out](https://github.com/DidacDV/Py_work/tree/main/Modules-inp_out) : Trying common modules and exploring python's options with input and ouput.

This will be updated while i have the required time.
